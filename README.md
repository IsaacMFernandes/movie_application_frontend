# IMDB Clone Full Stack Implementation: Front end

This codebase contains the React code to display the movie application in the browser.

It utilizes Axios to make calls to the Spring Boot REST API and CSS/Bootstrap to assist in formatting.

# To run
Ensure React is installed correctly by typing `npm install` at the root of this project.

Then simply enter the command: `npm start`.

For full functionality, you'll need to make sure the back end is running as well.
